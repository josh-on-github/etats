## Project Overview
The problem that my project solves is to streamline the process of choosing locations (States) in which to travel or potentially relocate.  States are ranked based upon several desirable categories and that ranking is weighted by the user based upon number of matches to said categories.

## Libraries/Packages/Modules
- json
- bs4
- urlopen

## Major Features
- About Page

### Essential Features
<!-- - User can create an account, login, and change password -->
- User can search states and save rankings by topic (tax, crime, housing, politics) and download/upload to localStorage
- User can create a favorites list to download to their device

### Non-Essential Features

## Data Models

### State Model
- `id` for element index
- `state_name` for state name abbreviation
- `tax_rate` for state effective tax burden
- `tax_rank` for state rank by `tax_rate`
- `political_affiliation` for state political affiliation by party of registered voters, legislative majority, and executive branch
- `median_home_value` for state median home value
- `crime_rate` for state violent/property crime rate by number of incidents per 100,000 people
- `crime_rank` for state rank by `crime_rate`
- `tourism_site` for a hyperlink to a state's official travel/tourism website

### Rank Model
- `weighted_rank` for state rank weighted by number of user matches: <sup>`tax_rate`, `political_affiliation`, `median_home_value`, and `crime_rate`</sup>
